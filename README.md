ABOUT
pyHarmonySearch is a pure Python implementation of the harmony search (HS) global optimization algorithm. HS is a metaheuristic search algorithm that, similar to simulated annealing, tabu, and evolutionary searches, is based on real world phenomena. Specifically, HS mimics a jazz band improvising together. Courtesy Wikipedia:

In the HS algorithm, each musician (= decision variable) plays (= generates) a note (= a value) for finding a best harmony (= global optimum) all together.
